# Linux Web Server Setup with Apache HTTPD

This repository contains Apache HTTPD configuration files used to set up a custom web server with the domain **deepakwebserver**.

## Overview

These files are from the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory of a CentOS/RHEL-based Linux server running Apache HTTPD. The main custom config file is `deepak_webserver.com.conf` which sets up the virtual host for the domain `deepakwebserver`.


## Step-by-step Setup Guide

### 1. Install Apache HTTPD (if not installed)

sudo dnf install httpd -y       # For CentOS/RHEL 8 or 9
# or
sudo yum install httpd -y       # For CentOS/RHEL 7

### 2. Copy configuration files
Copy the config files from this repository into the Apache config directory:

sudo cp *.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/

### 3. Configure your domain in the config file
The file `deepak_webserver.com.conf` contains the Apache virtual host configuration for your domain `deepakwebserver`.
Make sure the domain points to your serverâ€™s IP in your DNS settings or `/etc/hosts` for testing.

### 4. Start and enable Apache HTTPD service

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd


### 5. Verify the server and domain

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://deepakwebserver


You should see your custom web page served by Apache.


## Additional Notes

* To apply any changes to config files, restart Apache:
sudo systemctl restart httpd

* If you use a firewall, allow HTTP traffic:
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

## Troubleshooting

* Check Apache status:
sudo systemctl status httpd

* View Apache error logs:
sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/error_log
